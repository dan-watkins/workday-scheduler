# Workday Scheduler

## workday-scheduler

## Description

This is a simple calendar application that leverages DayJS to compare times and display scheduled events per hour and render either past, present, or future styling to each block. This allows for a visual indication of whether the scheduled event is in the past, current, or in the future. All events are saved into local storage and displayed in a basic HTML page.
